Advantages of V model
1. Highly disciplined 
2. Phases are completed one at a time
3. Good for small projects with well understood requirements
4. Simple to use and easy to understand
5. Easy to manage because of how rigid the model is.

Disadvantages of V model
1. High risk and uncertainty
2. Not good for complex or object oriented projects
3. Not suitable for long, ongoing projects
4. It is dificult to change or revert back once the appliacation is at testing stage
5. Working software is only produced later in the life cycle.

Advantages of Prototype model
1. Users are actively involved in the development
2. Errors can be found much sooner
3. Users can give feedback a lot quicker,resulting in better solutions
4. Missing functionality can be easily identified
5. Identification of confusing or difficult functions can be made

Disadvantages of Prototype model
1. Time consuming
2. Expensive
3. The incomplete application may not be used as the full system is intended to be, resultin in incomplete problem analysis
4. It may constrain the designer's ideas and reduce enthusiasm.
5. Can be difficult to measure the degree of difficulty to implement, causing unlimited development time.
